# ChallengeApi

### ChallengeApi - PHP Web API

> The API must allow the search for Cat Breeds by name. The API should cache the results from the Cat API into a local MySQL database. If the cat breed is not found in the local MySQL database, it will query the cat API. The only endpoint that must be implemented is the GET to /breeds
